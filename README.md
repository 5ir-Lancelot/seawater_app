## Python flask full stack web app
This python flask web app runs on vercel 



## Info
This app (my_app.py) is build with python Flask and dash to create a interactive dynamic application. 

The web host needs to support python Flask to deploy it. It can not be deployed on Streamlit
because it is not written in python streamlit language.

An attempt to convert it to streamlit language was done in (streamlit_app.py)
